70. #### Q69. Which choice is a reason to specify the type of a pointer instead of using `void *`, which works as a pointer to any type?
   Correct answer: The compiler needs the data type to know how much memory to allocate for the pointer because different data types require different pointer lengths.

71. #### Q70. What is wrong with this piece of code?
   Correct answer: The input operator flow is inverted. it should start from `std::cin` and then flow (>>) into `str`.
